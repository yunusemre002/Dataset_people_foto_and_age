# Dataset_people_foto_and_age
The dataset contains approximately 2,000 photos of individuals along with their birth dates, making it valuable for tasks such as image processing, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Specifically, it can be used for age estimation problems, where models learn to predict a person's age based on facial features. This dataset provides a unique set of data for AI applications in age-related studies.

The dataset was sourced from Turkey's list of wanted individuals for terrorism. However, not everyone in the dataset is a terrorist. The Turkish government has been criticized for labeling many opposition figures as terrorists, which has significantly inflated the list. The majority of individuals on this list are people who have dedicated themselves to peace and service to humanity, serving their country for many years without ever engaging in any violent acts. They come from a wide range of professions, including teachers, professors, doctors, military personnel, journalists, judges, prosecutors, housewives, and shopkeepers.
